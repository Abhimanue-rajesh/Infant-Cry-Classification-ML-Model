# Infant-Cry-Classification-ML-Model
This repository contains the source code and dataset for the CryMLClassifier, a machine learning model designed to classify baby cries into five types: burping, belly pain, discomfort, hungry, and tired. The model is trained on the "Donate a Cry Corpus Dataset," which is a publicly available dataset widely used for baby cry analysis.
